Java Programming Language

Portability, Speed, Security, Object Oriented

## Notes
Java is both a compiled and an interpreted language
Java source is compiled into a universal formatâ€”instructions for a virtual machine.
Compiled Java bytecode is executed by a Java runtime interpreter.
JIT: In addition to compiling source code down to portable bytecode, Java has also been carefully designed so that software implementations of the runtime system can further optimize their performance by compiling bytecode to native machine code on the fly. This is called just-in-time (JIT) or dynamic compilation.
